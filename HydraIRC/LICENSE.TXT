License & Distribution Rights
=============================

HydraIRC is currently free to use.  It will remain free for private use
but there will most likely be a charge to use it for commercial use after
v1.0 is released.

Commercial users are NOT licensed to use versions prior to v1.0 when v1.0
is released.

Anyone who is a politician or who works for any form of government body
is expressly forbidden to use any version of HydraIRC.

Fileplanet.com and any other site requiring membership of any kind before
users are allowed to download HydraIRC are expressly forbidden from
hosting any HydraIRC files on their site.

If you want to re-distribute HydraIRC then I (Dominic Clifton / Hydra) must
be contacted first.  Drop an e-mail to hydra at hydrairc dot com if you
require permission.

I'm not liable for anything at all.
