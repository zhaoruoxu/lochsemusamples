ThemeCreator
============

This is just a simple little program to help with theme creation, you can
type into either edit box and see the converted output in the other box as you type.

The escaped string is what you can copy and paste into your theme files.

Try pasting these example strings:

Unescaped string:
<TIMESTAMP=[%Hh %Mm]> <<NICK>> <ALL>

Escaped string:
\074TIMESTAMP=[%Hh %Mm]\076 \074\074NICK\076\076 \074ALL\076


Future
======

This program will either be scrapped entirely if theme creation is done in
the HydraIRC prefs, or it will be expanded to provide total theme creation
facilities.

Known Issues
============

* You can still type & < > or other non printable characters into the Escaped
  string box ideally they should be filtered.
